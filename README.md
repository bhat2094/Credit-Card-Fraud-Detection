# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
•	Predicted fraudulent credit card transactions from 300000 credit card data based on transaction time interval, transaction amount, and 28 other features resulted from PCA dimensionality reduction of sensitive data

•	Developed and compared unsupervised outlier detection algorithms, like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor, using several model performance indices such as precision, recall, f1-score, etc.

•	Utilized Python programming language with open-source libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and sklearn to develop the predictive model

•	Improved prediction of fraud detection by reducing over-prediction from 443 (Local Outlier Factor algorithm) to 155 (Isolation Forest)

•	Documented model development, presented data to team members, suggested strategies to further improve prediction (like SVM models), and shared existing codes with team members via Github repository
